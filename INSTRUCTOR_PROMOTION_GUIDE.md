## Remember

> "The belt only covers two inches of your ass. You have to cover the rest."
> — Royce Gracie

Promotions celebrate progress, but the real value is in the journey. Promote members when they're ready, not when they ask. Set high standards, but be encouraging. Every student's path is different.

**Your role as instructor is to guide, inspire, and recognize growth.**
